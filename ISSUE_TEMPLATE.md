Issues are used for 3 purposes, feature requests, bug documentation, and even development related conversations.

For **bugs**, you need these pieces of information:
1. Expected behavior
2. Steps to reproduce. A screenshot of the error. And a screen recording.
3. What OS were you using?
4. Debug log attached(if possible)

For **feature requests**, add as much of these details as possible:
Why? and summary of What?
Why should we add this feature?
What benefits will it add?

Detailed What?
Description: What does your new feature do?
Schematics: Can you diagram anything?
Concept art: If your feature 

How?
What steps can be taken to implement this code?
Are you coding this code?
Are you creating this code?

For **conversations**, it's really simple:
Just write your topic down, subject in the title ect. The only conversations that
should be done via the Issues if it deals with development.

Example appropriate topics:
* Documentation

In general, most conversations should take place in the IRC Channel except in rare cases.
